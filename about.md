#### **About**

**The Physical Activity Neurocognitive Outcomes (PANO)** application is a tool for visualizing results from research studies examining how physical activity and exercise training affects cognitive and neural outcomes. For example, currently the intervention database for PANO contains 349 unique results, or effects, that were included within 12 recently published meta-analyses. Our application aims to provide a tool for visualizing all of these results with user-defined filters to focus on the age-groups, intervention type, covariates, or outcomes of interest.

**Why have the PANO application if we can read each meta-analysis?** Published meta-analyses are static and have limited comparability over time to aid in synthesizing the literature for new insights and theory development. PANO provides a tool for interactively visualizing results across studies with user-defined inclusion criteria upon an updated database of studies. 

For example, meta-analyses summarize results of different cognitive tasks across multiple studies. However, in these analyses different cognitive tasks are grouped together as reflecting a common cognitive construct. While this can be useful, it can result in the same task being grouped into a cognitive domain operationalized with varying levels of breadth across different meta-analyses. A word list memory task may be grouped within “declarative memory”, “memory”, or “verbal memory” – with varying degrees of precision in what other tasks are included within the domain of “memory” across published meta-analyses. While comparing across these meta-analyses can be useful for detecting the breadth of exercise effects on the domain of memory, in practice individual meta-analyses are published at different times and their results (based on studies included) are a static snapshot that is not directly comparable to a study published even five years later in a rapidly moving field. To address these issues, PANO is sourced by a continuously updated database of results at the level of the cognitive task, and provides user-defined options for interactively varying the breadth and/or theoretical grouping principle for aggregating across individual outcomes. 

PANO also provides interactive filters to visualize results across studies with user-defined inclusion parameters that can be applied on an updated database of study results. This is because published meta-analysis studies make choices about the sample characteristics, outcomes, and study features that they intend to focus on. If you would like to see the results with slightly different criteria imposed, such as a more narrow age range or intervention type, this can’t be done without re-entering effect sizes and essentially re-doing the work of the authors.
